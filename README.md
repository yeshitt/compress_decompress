# compress_decompress
This project is made to compress or decompress any file.


In this project we have used Huffman Coding Principle to compress and decompress text file.
You can learn about HUFFMAN CODING from this article - [Huffman coding](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/text-file-compression-and-decompression-using-huffman-coding/)

We have used google colab for coding in python.

You need to clone this project on your system or you can just simply copy the code and run it on your editor.


After running it you just need to enter the path of your text file.

After this you just run it and the compressed and decompressed files are generated in the same folder
